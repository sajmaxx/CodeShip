                        In November 2010, the Double Down was launched in select branches in the Philippines, the first in Asia. Nearly one year later, in October 2011, KFC Philippines replaced it with the Zinger Double Down, with a spicy flavor and crunchy skin. <br>
                         The product was discontinued in the Philippines in mid-2012, but reintroduced in January 2014 together with a smaller version, the Junior Double Down. <br> It was discontinued yet again in May 2014, <br>but relaunched in January 2015 for a limited time only, together with a new variation, the Double Down Dog. In January 2016, another new variation was introduced, the Double Down G which contained "crispy fried spinach" with a "secret green sauce". In March 2019, the Original Double Down and the Junior Double Down returned to the menu and in April 2019, the Zinger Double Down was also reintroduced.
                        The Zinger Double Down was sold from December 1, 2012 through March 1, 2013, and re-released in October 2013 along with a variant named Zinger Double Down MAXX with added hash brown patty and salsa.[8][better source needed] <br>
                        Both the Zinger Double Down and the Double Down MAXX were later added as a year-round menu in March 2014, and in April the original Double Down was also made available. In October 2014, the Zinger Double Down KING was announced, <br>
                         with a beef patty and barbecue sauce in the middle of two Zinger patties.[9][better source needed]<br>
                        In July 2018, the Double Down was launched in select branches in Bangkok, It was later reintroduce in May 2019[10] <br>
                        KFC Indonesia introduced the Double Down starting on 1st February 2020. Also to meet Halal standards as in Singapore and Malaysia, bacon was replaced by Hash Browns.[11]  <br>

                        Hamburg was a common embarcation point for transatlantic voyages during the first half of the 19th century and New York City was the most common destination. <br>
                         Various New York restaurants offered Hamburg-style American fillet,[1][2] or even beefsteak à Hambourgeoise. Early American preparations of minced beef were therefore made to fit the tastes of European immigrants. <br>[3]
                        Origin of the name                       
                        Coming from this history of ground meat dishes is the Salisbury steak. James Salisbury (1823–1905) was an American physician and chemist known for his advocacy of a meat-centered diet to promote health, and the term Salisbury steak for a ground beef patty served as an entree has been used in the United States since 1897.[4] Today, Salisbury steak is usually served with a gravy similar in texture to brown sauce, along with various side dishes. It is a common item in supermarket frozen food sections.                    
                        Dr. Salisbury recommended this recipe (somewhat different from modern Salisbury steak recipes) for the treatment of alimentation (digestive problems):      <br>                   
                        Eat the muscle pulp of lean beef made into cakes and broiled. This pulp should be as free as possible from connective or glue tissue,<br> fat and cartilage...previous to chopping, the fat, bones, tendons and fasciae should all be cut away, <br>and the lean muscle cut up in pieces an inch or two square. Steaks cut through the centre of the round are the richest and best for this purpose. Beef should be procured from well fatted animals that are from four to six years old.
                        The pulp should not be pressed too firmly together before broiling, or it will taste livery. <br> Simply press it sufficiently to hold it together. Make the cakes from half an inch to an inch thick. Broil slowly and moderately well over a fire free from blaze and smoke. When cooked, put it on a hot plate and season to taste with butter, pepper, salt; also use either Worcestershire or Halford sauce, mustard, horseradish or lemon juice on the meat if desired. Celery may be moderately used as a relish.[5]

                       Sushi originates in the Baiyue cuisine in ancient southern China, a dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time.[3]  <br>The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]
                       Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"           <br>              
                       Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. <br>In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.                        
                       It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. <br> The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. <br>
                       One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay);<br>
                        the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[8][9]                        
                       The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, <br>
                       A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring". <br>
                       [10][11] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[12] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.[13]
