                Do not go gentle into that good night, <br>
                Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
            </p>
            <p id='para2'>
                Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
                Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
                Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
            </p>
            <p id='para3'>
                Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <br>
                Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
            </p>
            <p id='para4'>
                Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <br>
                And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
                Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
