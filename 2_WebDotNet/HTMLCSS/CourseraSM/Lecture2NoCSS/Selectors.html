        Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <br>
        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
      </p>  
      <p class='evenpara'>
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <br>
        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, <br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
      </p>  
      <p class='oddpara'>
        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight <br>
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, <br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
      </p>
      <p class='evenpara'>
        And you, my father, there on that sad height, <br>
        Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. <br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
